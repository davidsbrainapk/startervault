## 🎯 What do you want to achieve?
- Lose 10 lbs
- Gain lean muscle
- Learn to handstand

## 🔥 Why does it matter?

- I want to show up better for my kids
- I want to be proud of how I move, look, and feel

## 🛠 How will you do it?
- Train 3–5x/week with a focus on bodyweight
- Track food 5 days per week
- Practice breathwork + awareness daily

## 🚧 Who or what will try to stop you?
- My lazy inner voice
- Susan and her brownies
- My old beliefs telling me I can’t change

## 🧠 My pattern interrupts
- I will get up and move for 30 seconds when I feel stuck
- I will screenshot my wins
- I will remind myself: "If I don’t do it, who will?"
