### 🥣 Nutrition

**Stuck to food plan?**

**How did I respond?**  
→ I just felt like I should be more capable than this...

### 🏆 Any Wins Today?

**Did something awesome happen?**  
→ Wins:: I found this vault online to start journaling. I owe it to myself to live the life I want, and it starts here with me. I’m going to create my plan and review it daily.

### 🛠 Lessons & Adjustments

**What will I try differently tomorrow?**  
→ I’m going to go for a long walk instead of watching TV this evening. Maybe I’ll bring a backpack with some weight in it. I’m sure Noctis will love evening walks — he deserves more exercise too. 🐾
