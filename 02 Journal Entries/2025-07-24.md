### 🧠 Mindset Check

**Read your plan?**  
→ Yeah — and this time I actually _read_ it, not just skimmed it like a Terms of Service.

**Awareness level today (1–10):**  
→ Solid 6. I caught myself mindlessly scrolling twice... but at least I _noticed_.

### 💪 Training

**Did I train?**  
→ Yep.

**Type of training:**  
→ Just a basic bodyweight flow — push-ups, squats, hangs. Still easing in, but I showed up.

**Intensity (1–10):**  
→ 4. Kept it chill, broke a sweat but didn’t go Super Saiyan.

**Notes:**  
→ My wrists felt a little creaky during the hangs, but nothing crazy. Need to stretch forearms more.

### 🥣 Nutrition

**Stuck to food plan?**  
→ Yeah, kept it clean. Logged everything too.

**If no, what happened and what will I do differently next time?**  
→ N/A

### 🎯 Reflection

**What went well?**  
→ I kept my promises to myself today. That’s a damn good feeling.

**What didn’t?**  
→ Got distracted mid-afternoon and lost a couple hours to YouTube rabbit holes. Productivity took a hit.

**What triggered me?**  
→ Honestly? Seeing someone online doing the thing I’ve been _talking_ about doing.

**How did I respond?**  
→ Felt a spark of frustration — then used it. Shut the app, got up, and trained.

### 🏆 Any Wins Today?

**Did something awesome happen?**  
→ Wins:: It's been a year since I started my journey... I’m down 30 pounds and still going! I feel amazing!

### 🛠 Lessons & Adjustments

**What will I try differently tomorrow?**  
→ Going to block my mid-day window so I don't slip into distraction mode. Might even stack some movement in there — walk, stretch, anything but doomscroll.
