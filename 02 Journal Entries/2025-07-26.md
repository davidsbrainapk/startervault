### 🎯 Reflection

**What went well?**  
→ I was sore today and had that “I deserve it” urge. I hovered over my phone, ready to order something bad... but I paused. Ended up throwing a frozen cauliflower pizza in the oven instead — added bacon and cheese, and it still came in under 1200 calories. It hit the spot. I’m proud I didn’t smash 3500 calories in one meal. That’s real progress.

**What didn’t?**  
→ I was kind of aimless all morning — kept circling the kitchen like a shark. I wasn’t really hungry... just bored.

**What triggered me?**  
→ The soreness. The downtime. The combo made me crave comfort food and dopamine hits.

**How did I respond?**  
→ I stared at the phone. Almost folded. But I redirected. I made a solid choice instead — one that aligned with my goals.

### 🏆 Any Wins Today?

**Did something awesome happen?**  
→ Wins:: I was filling my water cup and caught Jen staring at my triceps... so I locked eyes, curled the arm, and kissed the bicep. She looked visibly upset. Some girls just can’t handle the gun show, I guess. 💪😎

### 🛠 Lessons & Adjustments

**What will I try differently tomorrow?**  
→ I’ll be more active on rest days. A rest day doesn’t mean couch-locked. Laying around all day makes it way too easy to fixate on food. From now on, I’ll go for a walk or short hike as part of recovery. Movement will help me heal — and distract me from the kitchen sirens.
