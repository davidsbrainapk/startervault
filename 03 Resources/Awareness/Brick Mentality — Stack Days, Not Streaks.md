## ðŸ§± Brick Mentality â€” Stack Days, Not Streaks

> [!quote] "You are not starting over. You are stacking bricks."

Most people think of fitness or habit change like a _streak_ â€” a perfect line of checked boxes. And when they miss a day, they say:

- "Welp, I blew it."
    
- "I have to start over."
    
- "I ruined everything."
    

But that's not how this works.

You're not building a line. You're building a wall â€” one **brick** at a time.

### Why This Mentality Wins

- **No guilt spiral**: You don't feel like a failure for missing a day.
    
- **Focus on the big picture**: You see your progress even with gaps.
    
- **Built-in resilience**: You bounce back faster from bad days.
    

### Stack Bricks Like This:

- âœ… Show up and do _something_ â€” even 5 pushups = a brick.
    
- ðŸ§± Keep track of how many bricks youâ€™ve laid (not how perfect it looks)
    
- ðŸ§  Missed a day? Cool. Start laying the next brick. Thatâ€™s it.
    

### Bonus: Use Daily Notes as Your Brick Log

Every entry in your `02 Journal Entries` folder is a brick. Over time, youâ€™ll see the wall youâ€™ve built. Thatâ€™s real. Thatâ€™s progress.

> [!tip] Visualize it: Instead of deleting your missed days, leave a blank brick in the wall. One day wonâ€™t define you â€” the full structure will.

Keep stacking, Buh-ro.
