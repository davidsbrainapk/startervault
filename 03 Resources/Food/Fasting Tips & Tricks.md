## ⏳ Fasting Tips & Tricks

_How to fast like a human, not a monk_

Fasting can feel like a superpower — clearer mind, more discipline, better fat burn. But only if you do it **smart**, not hardcore-for-no-reason.

Here’s how to make fasting _sustainable_ and _adaptable_, not a willpower deathmatch.

### 💡 Real-World Fasting Wisdom

- **Drink water before the hunger hits**  
    Staying ahead of thirst keeps hunger away too. Add lemon, salt, or electrolytes if needed.
    
- **Have a “Break Glass” emergency snack**  
    A small bag of almonds, beef jerky, or protein puffs in your glove box or backpack is _not_ cheating.  
    It’s insurance against the drive-thru demon.
    
- **Black coffee, green tea, sparkling water = tools**  
    These kill appetite and help you coast through long fasts.  
    Don’t overdo the caffeine though — you’ll crash.
    
- **Don’t plan intense workouts at your fasting low point**  
    Fasted walks? Great. Fasted deadlifts after 20 hours? Chill, Gohan.  
    Time your harder workouts near the end of the fast or post-refeed.
    
- **Use a countdown timer or fasting app (if needed)**  
    Seeing the clock tick down helps mentally. Some good ones: Zero, Fastic, or just a Pomodoro-style timer.
    
- **Stay busy, not food-focused**  
    Most people break fast because they’re bored, not hungry.  
    Start a task, go on a walk, wash your car — anything to shift focus.

### 🍽 When It’s Time to Break the Fast

- **Start small and protein-first**  
    A protein shake or eggs work better than a huge carb bomb — ease your body back online.
    
- **Don’t revenge eat**  
    “I earned this!” is how you undo 20 hours of discipline in 20 minutes of chaos.
    
- **Rehydrate**  
    You lost water and electrolytes during the fast — put ‘em back before training or a full meal.

### 🧠 Remember:

- You’re not _supposed_ to feel amazing during every fast.  
    There will be dips, moments of irritability, and temptation — that’s the point.  
    What matters is knowing it’s _temporary_ and pushing through with awareness.
    

> [!tip] If you’re truly _miserable_, break the fast wisely and regroup. One misstep is nothing. The real damage is quitting altogether.
