## 🧃 Food Cheat Sheet by Macro

> Know what you're eating — fuel on purpose

### 🥩 **Protein (Build & Repair Muscle)**

Aim to get this in every meal. Most underrated macro when cutting.

- Chicken breast, turkey, lean beef
    
- Eggs or egg whites
    
- Fish (salmon, tuna, cod)
    
- Greek yogurt (plain or low sugar)
    
- Cottage cheese
    
- Protein powders (whey, casein, vegan)
    
- Tofu or tempeh
    
- Edamame
    

> [!tip] Rule of thumb: if it walks, swims, or clucks, it’s likely protein.

### 🥑 **Fats (Hormones, Satiety, Brain)**

Don’t fear fat — just measure it. Easy to overeat.

- Avocado
    
- Nuts & seeds (almonds, walnuts, chia)
    
- Olive oil, coconut oil, butter
    
- Egg yolks
    
- Fatty fish (salmon, sardines)
    
- Cheese (hard cheeses are lower in carbs)

Best used for fuel, especially around training.

- Brown rice, white rice
    
- Sweet potatoes, red potatoes
    
- Quinoa
    
- Whole grain bread/pasta (read labels)
    
- Lentils, beans
    

> [!tip] These keep you full and give you steady energy.

### 🍭 **Carbohydrates – Simple (Fast Energy / Glycogen Reload)**

Good for quick fuel or post-workout carb-up.

- White rice (post-depletion = 🐉 mode)
    
- Bananas, apples, berries
    
- Honey, jam, maple syrup
    
- Fruit juice
    
- Gummy bears (yes, seriously… post-lift only!)
    
- Sports drinks like Gatorade Zero w/ sugar if refueling
    

> [!warning] Don’t abuse these. Use them like a weapon — not a habit.
