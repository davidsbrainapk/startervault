# What Are Processed Foods?

Processed foods are any foods that have been altered in some way from their original form — typically for convenience, preservation, or taste. That “altered” can be as simple as chopping or freezing... or as intense as chemical extraction, additives, and ultra-refined ingredients.

## ⚠️ Types of Processing

Not all processed foods are bad — it’s a spectrum:

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Minimally Processed** | Basic prep like washing, cutting, freezing | Frozen veggies, bagged spinach, roasted nuts |
| **Processed** | Added ingredients like sugar, salt, or oils | Bread, cheese, canned tuna, peanut butter |
| **Ultra-Processed** | Heavily modified with additives and industrial ingredients | Chips, soda, candy, frozen meals, fast food |

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Ultra-processed foods are **engineered to override your hunger signals**. They’re designed to be addictive — high in calories, low in nutrients, and easy to binge.

> You’re not weak — they’re just built that way.

Over time, a diet high in ultra-processed food can:
- Spike inflammation
- Disrupt blood sugar regulation
- Increase fat storage
- Wreck gut health and cravings
- Reduce energy and focus

## ✅ What to Do Instead

You don’t have to go full caveman. Just aim for:

- **Single-ingredient foods** (meat, rice, eggs, fruit, veg)
- **Minimally processed options** (frozen veggies > frozen pizza)
- **Cooking at home** more often
- **Reading labels** (if it has 30 ingredients and sounds like a science experiment... maybe not)

## 🧪 The Litmus Test

If you:
- Could eat *way more* than you intended
- Don’t feel full afterward
- Can’t identify most of the ingredients

...it’s probably ultra-processed.

## Final Thought

Swap the junk. Stack the habits. You don’t have to be perfect — just more aware.  
Each better choice adds up.
