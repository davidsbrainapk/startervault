## 🥦 Leverage Glycogen — **Ultimate Gohan Mode**

_Use depletion and refueling to unlock your final form._

> [!quote] “When your cells are empty… and you feed them right… they go Super Saiyan.”

### ⚡️ What This Is

This protocol uses a **glycogen depletion and refill cycle** to temporarily _supercharge_ your physique and pump. Think: veiny, vascular, tight, and powerful. It’s also a great mental reset and can reignite your motivation during a cut.

### 🧬 The 7-Day Protocol

> ⚠️ **Beginner note**: This is for intermediate+ folks who already train consistently and want to experiment with fuel manipulation. Don't stress if you don’t nail it the first time — you’ll still learn your body.

### 👇 Here’s how to activate **Ultimate Gohan Mode**:

#### **Day 1–3: Deplete Glycogen (Training Arc)**

- 🥦 **Eat very low carbs** — keep it under **50g per day**
    
- 🔥 **Train one muscle group per day:**
    
    - **Day 1**: Upper Body → Pushups (incline, decline, diamond), pullups, dips, crunches
        
    - **Day 2**: Lower Body → Bodyweight squats, lunges, step-ups, calf raises
        
    - **Day 3**: HIIT/Metcon → 24 mins total
        
        - 30 sec: High knees (or marching)
            
        - 30 sec: Burpees
            
        - 30 sec: Jumping jacks
            
        - 30 sec: Rest  
            (Repeat x6)
            

#### **Evening of Day 3: Refeed (The Sensu Bean)**

- 🍝 Eat a high-carb meal (think pasta, potatoes, rice) with protein — chicken teriyaki with white rice is a great choice...
    
- 🧃 Drink the **Glycogen Replenisher**:
    
    - 25–40g fast-acting carbs (e.g., Gatorade or juice)

    - 10g whey protein (optional)
        

#### **Day 4: The Transformation**

- 🏋️‍♂️ Train in the morning while refueled.
    
- Add a **weighted vest** or push harder than usual.
    
- You’ll feel _charged_ — energy, vascularity, and pump will be 🔥🔥🔥.

### 🧠 What This Does (And Why It Works)

| Phase                       | What’s Happening                                        | Why It Matters                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Depletion**               | You burn through stored glycogen (the body’s carb fuel) | Muscles flatten out and become highly insulin sensitive            |
| **Training While Depleted** | Pushes your body into using fat for fuel                | Also primes your muscles to soak up carbs like a sponge            |
| **Refeed**                  | Carbs are reintroduced after 3 days                     | Muscles refill, volume returns, vascularity pops, you feel amazing |
| **Training After Refeed**   | You now have full muscle bellies and optimal energy     | This is the window to go hard and push your performance            |

### 🔥 Bonus Tips

- 💧 **Stay hydrated** — Glycogen pulls water into your muscles. Expect to drop water weight during depletion and then bounce back.
    
- 🛌 **Sleep well** the night before your refeed training — your recovery will supercharge your results.
    
- 🧠 **Mental boost** — This feels amazing when you pull it off. Like watching yourself go Ultra Instinct on Day 4.

> [!info] This isn't magic — it's timing, physiology, and intent. Use it once every few weeks for motivation, photo shoots, special events, or just for fun. Don’t abuse it. Don’t try to stay depleted. You need both sides of the coin to see results.
