### 🧠 Why Sleep Matters

Sleep is the foundation. Not just for training — for _everything_.  
Your mood, focus, recovery, hunger cues, metabolism… all of it.

- Poor sleep makes you irritable, foggy, and inflamed
    
- Good sleep makes you sharper, leaner, and more emotionally resilient
    
- You can literally _wake up looking leaner_ after a good night’s sleep
    

> [!note] I used to laugh when older clients told me sleep was the secret.  
> I didn’t learn the truth until my 30s… now I take it more seriously than training.

### 🛏 Buh-Ro’s Sleep Hygiene Protocol

> [!tip] These are practices, not rules. The more you follow, the better you’ll feel.

#### 🌅 Anchor Your Circadian Rhythm

- **Morning sunlight** — even just 5 minutes outside within 30 mins of waking
    
- **Evening walks at sunset** — signals your body to wind down
    

#### 🌙 Create a Sleep-First Environment

- **Blackout curtains**
    
- **Ear plugs**
    
- **Eye mask**
    
- **Mouth tape** (if it helps you nasal breathe)
    
- **No pets in bed** — Yes, I love my dog. But crate training changed my sleep forever.
    

#### 💡 Reduce Stimulation

- **Dim lights after sunset** — better: use red lights or warm bulbs
    
- **Blue light blockers** — wear them after dark
    
- **Nightlights on all screens** — system settings, browser, everything
    

#### 🧘‍♂️ Wind Down Right

- **Avoid caffeine/stims after 2pm** (some even earlier)
    
- **Put your phone away** — especially avoid social media before bed
    
- **Watch something chill** — No hype movies before bed
