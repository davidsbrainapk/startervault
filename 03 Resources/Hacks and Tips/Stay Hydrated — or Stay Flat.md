## 💧 Stay Hydrated — or Stay Flat

### Why It Matters

Hydration isn’t just about not being thirsty. It’s about how well your body **moves, performs, recovers, and burns fat**.

If you're even _slightly_ dehydrated:

- Your strength drops
    
- You feel “flat” and deflated
    
- You mistake thirst for hunger
    
- Your joints ache more
    
- You can’t focus
    
- You’ll feel like crap mid-cut for _no good reason_

### How to Stay on Top of It

- **Start your day with a big glass** — before coffee
    
- **Add electrolytes** if you sweat a lot (or train hard)
    
    - LMNT, Celtic salt + lemon, or Gatorade Zero
        
- **Keep a bottle nearby** — if it’s not in sight, it’s out of mind
    
- **Aim for clear pee** — light yellow = 👌
    
- **Drink between meals** — not just at meals
    
- **Carry water if you’re outside or running errands**

### 🚩 Warning Signs You’re Slipping

- Headache or brain fog
    
- Muscle cramps or twitching
    
- Low energy despite eating enough
    
- Scale not budging (dehydration = water retention)
    
- Mood swings (yup, water even helps that)

### Pro Tip: _“Pee Math”_

If you train hard and barely pee during the day — you’re behind. Big time.  
If you suddenly start peeing more after hydrating, you just pulled your body out of **emergency mode**.

> [!tip] You don’t need to drink a gallon a day unless you’re huge or training like Goku. But if you’re drinking 2–3 cups total and wondering why you feel like crap? That’s your villain origin story right there.
