### 🧠 Don’t Let the Scale Mind-F You

The scale is a tool — not a truth-teller.

Your weight can fluctuate 2–5 lbs _in a single day_ depending on:

- Salt
    
- Sleep
    
- Stress
    
- Hormones
    
- Glycogen levels
    
- Water retention
    
- That monster burrito you forgot to log 😅
    

> [!danger] So when you see the number go _up_ even though you trained and ate clean — don’t panic. That’s not fat gain. That’s normal.

### 👖 Use Jeans, Not Just the Scale

The best tool for tracking real-world progress?

**Your pants.**

- Got a pair you wish fit better? Use that as your guide.
    
- Are they looser in the thighs? Waist? Butt? That’s _real change_.
    
- Scale stuck but pants fitting better? You’re probably recomposing — burning fat while building muscle.

### 📈 When to Use the Scale

- Track it weekly, _not daily_.
    
- Log it to see trends, not to determine your mood.
    
- Weigh under the same conditions: fasted, after morning pee, no clothes.
    

That number is just _data_.  
The real question: Are you moving better? Feeling stronger? Fitting into clothes with ease?

### 🧠 Pro Tip: Recomp is Real

> [!success] Muscle weighs more than fat but takes up less space.

You might weigh the same but look completely different.  
That’s the _magic_ of staying consistent.
