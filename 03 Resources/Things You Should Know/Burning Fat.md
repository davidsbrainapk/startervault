## 🔥 Burning Fat

_What to expect when your body starts dipping into its reserves._

> [!quote] “Fat loss is simple, not easy. It’s a test of consistency, not perfection.”

### 🎯 What’s Actually Happening?

Burning fat isn’t just about “eating clean” or doing cardio — it’s about creating a **caloric deficit** consistently. That means your body is burning more energy than it’s taking in.

To meet this energy demand, your body starts breaking down **stored glycogen** (your short-term fuel tank in muscle and liver) and then gradually taps into **fat reserves**.

### ⚠️ What It _Feels_ Like (That No One Warns You About)

- **Glycogen Dump = Rapid Scale Drop**  
    In the first few days of a deficit (especially if you reduce carbs), you’ll likely see a fast drop on the scale. This is mostly water weight from glycogen being burned off — not actual fat yet. Don’t get too excited. Don’t get too scared when the drop slows either.
    
- **You Might Feel Smaller or “Flat”**  
    Muscles might look softer or feel less pumped — totally normal. You didn’t lose all your gains. Your muscles are temporarily flatter from less glycogen and water. Once you refeed or eat maintenance again, they’ll perk back up.
    
- **Mood Dips Are Common at First**  
    Expect irritability, hunger waves, or lower patience in the beginning. You’re rewiring a reward system that’s been food-triggered for years. This normalizes with consistency.
    
- **Energy Can Be Inconsistent**  
    You might crush a workout one day and feel like a zombie the next. Stay on your plan, prioritize sleep and protein, and stay hydrated. Your body is adapting.
    
- **The Mind Will Try to Justify Quitting**  
    Your brain doesn’t like discomfort. Expect thoughts like:
    
    - “This isn’t working”
        
    - “I need more calories to train hard”
        
    - “Maybe I should just bulk instead”
        
    
    These are **normal** resistance voices. Stay the course.
    

### 🧠 Tips to Survive the Cut

- **Stay busy when hunger hits** — boredom is often mistaken for hunger.
    
- **Drink water and electrolytes** — dehydration makes everything worse.
    
- **Track weekly averages** — ignore daily weight swings.
    
- **Don’t cut calories too hard** — slow and sustainable wins.
    
- **Lift heavy** — maintain muscle while burning fat.
    
- **Log your mindset daily** — observe your patterns.

### ✅ When It Gets Better

Usually within 2–3 weeks:

- Hunger becomes manageable
    
- Mood normalizes
    
- Scale trends become predictable
    
- Workouts feel better again
    
- Visible definition begins to show
    

This is where the magic happens. You’ll feel lighter, tighter, sharper. But you have to **earn this phase** by pushing through the suck first.
