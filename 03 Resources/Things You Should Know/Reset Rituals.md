## 🔁 Reset Rituals

**Why You Need to Unplug on Purpose**

If you want lasting results, you can’t just build habits — you need to build **systems to reboot yourself** when life inevitably gets loud.

A _reset ritual_ is a way to clear the mental cache. It's how you **interrupt overwhelm, boredom, burnout, cravings, self-doubt, or loops** before they spiral into sabotage.  
Not every bad day needs to end in a binge or a spiral. You can _catch it_... if you notice it.

These rituals help you get back to clarity, intention, and control — without needing a whole life overhaul.

## 🧠 Why It Works

- **Breaks the loop** — Interrupts autopilot patterns like scrolling, snacking, or zoning out
    
- **Signals your brain** — That you’re entering a new mode (calm, focused, intentional)
    
- **Promotes awareness** — Puts you back in the driver’s seat
