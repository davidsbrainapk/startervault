## 🧬 What _Is_ & _Isn’t_ Possible for You

### 🧠 The Trap of Chasing Someone Else’s Build

I spent years training with guys who all wanted to get **big** — chasing the 185+ club like it was the only valid goal. And even though I never truly wanted that for myself… I still did it.

I’m not a tall guy. So when I bulked up to 187, I looked like a **mini fridge in a hoodie**. Clothes were either way too tight or way too long. Pants didn’t fit right. Shirts bunched weird. My body felt like a compromise between strength and style — and I never felt quite at home in it.

But then I found **calisthenics**. Leaned out. Got light. Built a sneaky build that doesn’t scream "look at me" — but definitely gets noticed. And you know what?

That felt like _me_.  
That was what I’d been chasing the whole time — I just didn’t know it.

### 🎯 The Point: Train for _Your_ Frame

Don’t copy someone else’s goals just because they’re in your circle or lifting crew.

A 6'1" guy at 190 pounds might look athletic and tapered.  
But a 5'7" guy at 190? Might look like he’s built for rugby… but forgot to join the team.

Size is contextual.  
Aesthetics are proportional.  
**Self-respect > comparison.**

> [!tip] Return to _stock_ — lean, agile, capable. Then decide if you want to build from there.

### ✅ Why This Matters

- **Clothes fit better**  
    You’ll stop fighting the mirror and your wardrobe.
    
- **You move better**  
    Calisthenics thrives when you’re light. Less joint pain. More control.
    
- **You’ll probably get more compliments**  
    The lean build is underrated. Clean. Capable. Eye-catching when it’s earned.
    
- **You’ll stop being an NPC**  
    Most guys bulk by default. It’s the loud path. You’re choosing the _intentional_ one.

### 🧠 Final Reminder

Understand your limitations — not as restrictions, but as **design specs**.

- If your frame is shorter, don’t let tall-guy goals hijack your process.
    
- If your goal is function and aesthetics, not powerlifting or bodybuilding, don’t eat like it is.
    
- If you want to feel light, sharp, and confident in your own skin — pursue **that**.
    

Train for you.  
Build what fits your _life_ — not just your gym buddies.
