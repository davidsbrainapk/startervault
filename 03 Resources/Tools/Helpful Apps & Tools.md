## 🧰 Helpful Apps & Tools

_Use the tech. Win the day._

These are the actual tools that helped me stay consistent, cut the noise, and get results. You don’t need _all_ of them — but pick the ones that solve real problems for you.

### 📱 Apps That Slap

- **Alarmy** — Brutal alarm app that forces you out of bed by solving math, taking a picture, or scanning a barcode. A sleep cycle reset button.
    
- **MyFitnessPal** — OG macro + calorie tracker. Sync it with your scale or just log what you eat like a grown adult.
    
- **Tasker (Android)** — Automate your phone like a robot butler. I use it to send myself awareness prompts, like “Buh-Ro… stop snackin’.”

> [!tip] Don’t over-track. Use your tools to _guide behavior_, not to micromanage it.

### 🛠 Tools That Actually Help

- **[Food Scale](https://amzn.to/41gREcH)** — Non-negotiable. Eyeballing portions is why you’re stuck.  
    Weigh it once, learn it forever.
    
- **[Weighted Vest](https://amzn.to/3GMi2V3)** — Turns bodyweight training into a whole different game. Walk the dog or hit pullups in this and become a menace.
    
- [**Pull-Up Bar (Doorframe style)**](https://amzn.to/45nApcb) — No excuses. Mount it once. Use it daily.
    
- **[Resistance Bands](https://amzn.to/40GcSR3)** — Great for mobility, warmups, and burnout sets.
    
- **Infrared Heat Lamp or [Heating Pad](https://amzn.to/41etaAK)** — For recovery, soreness, or when your back feels 94 years old.
    
- **[Indoor Grill](https://amzn.to/44Sc91G)** — Fast, easy protein hits. No excuses when you’re tired.

### 🧠 Optional, But Useful

- **[Dry Erase Board](https://amzn.to/456xOCd)** — Great for visualizing the week at a glance.
    
- **[Noise-Cancelling Earplugs](https://amzn.to/4fcZjPh) and [Sleep Mask](https://amzn.to/44PnG1P)** — If you can’t sleep, you can’t recover.
  
- [Mouth Tape](https://www.hostagetape.com/DAVID39028) — Encourage **nasal breathing** throughout the night 
    
- **[Activity Tracker](https://amzn.to/46zV91D)** — Tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, weight, stress. A tracker with a move alert is very helpful. Use it for _data_, not dopamine.
