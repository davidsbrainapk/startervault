## 🧭 Welcome to _The Order of Things_

You’ve taken the first step in building your personal transformation system. This vault is designed to help you turn the concepts from _The Order of Things_ series into a daily, usable tool.

Use it however works best for you — rewrite it, simplify it, or make it your own.  
Start by filling out **[[My Plan]]** ← This will populate your dashboard with your goals and reminders, so they stay top of mind.

When you open Obsidian, it’ll default to your dashboard — but you can change that later.
### 🎯 Project Goal

The mission is to help you recognize NPC behavior and engage your real self — using fitness as a doorway to reclaiming your agency and living your best life.

## ⚙️ Using the Vault “As Is”

If you want to use this vault exactly as it is — go for it.  
Just **don’t delete or rename** any lines that use double colons like this ➡️ :: — the dashboard needs those to work.

There’s a file called `Daily_Tracker_Template.md` inside `/templates`.  
⚠️ **Don’t edit that file directly** — it powers your daily logs.

Also, feel free to delete the test notes in 02 Journal Entries.

The rolling quote block refreshes each time Obsidian is opened or reloaded. You can tweak that if you're feeling spicy.
